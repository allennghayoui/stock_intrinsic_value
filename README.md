<h1>Stock Intrinsic Value Tool</h1>

<p>
  This tool takes a stock symbol (U.S. Stock Market) and returns the current price of the stock and the intrinsic value based on the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method.
  Since this tool uses the free tier of the Financial Modeling Prep API it is limited to 250 requests per day.
